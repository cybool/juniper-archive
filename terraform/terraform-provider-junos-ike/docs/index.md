The `terraform-provider-junos-ike` provider is used to interact with a Juniper SRX firewall. This provider is meant to serve as an educational tool to show users how:
1. use providers to [create, read, update and delete (CRUD) resources](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/provider-use?in=terraform/providers) using Terraform.
1. create a custom Terraform provider.

To learn how to re-create the `terraform-provider-junos-ike` provider, refer to the [Official Documentation](https://cdot65.github.io/juniper-terraform-srx/) for a walkthrough.
