# Juniper Terraform Example: Policy based IPsec VPN

[![N|Solid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdot65/juniper-terraform-srx/dev/site/content/assets/images/topology.png)](https://juniper.net/)

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an example method to interact with Juniper SRX products with Terraform.

This project will build a policy-based VPN on a Juniper SRX firewall
