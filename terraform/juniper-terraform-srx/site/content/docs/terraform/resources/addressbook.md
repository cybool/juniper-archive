## üéâ Welcome

This project is for network developers looking to build, deploy, and validate an edge network design with [Juniper Apstra](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products/network-automation/apstra.html) and [RedHat Ansible](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible).

For those looking to get started with either network automation or VXLAN/EVPN fabrics, this project can help you get familiar with the concepts and technologies necessary for success.

## ‚ùì How to use this guide

The navigation menu on the left hand of this site will be the best method of navigating between the documents.

### Automation

This is where we will cover the automation covered by our Ansible Collection. Information about Roles, Plugins, and Modules will be discussed in detail.

The all-important code deep dive will be taking place here, as well as a discussion around the various tools provided within the project to make our lives easier.

### Network

This can be considered optional if you're only here for the Ansible, but it's really cool too. We will cover topics like IP addressing, VXLAN/EVPN fabric design, and control-plane details.

### Lab Environment

We have provided a lab in [Juniper vLabs](https://jlabs.juniper.net/vlabs/) to accompany this guide; an EVE-NG topology file has also been provided for those without access to Juniper vLabs. This section can be considered optional, only to be referenced if you're planning to execute this project firsthand.
