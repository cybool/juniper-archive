When your topology is up and running, we'll focus our attention on the server labeled "Automation". Hover your mouse over the server and a pop-up menu will appear.

Selecting SSH from the menu will find your browser jumping into an SSH session with the server.

Change into the directory container our project, and perform a `git pull` operation to make sure you're using the latest copy. There will be a lot of updates, don't worry if the screen fills up.

```bash
cd automation/apstra-edge-ansible
git pull
```

![git pull](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdot65/juniper-terraform-srx/dev/site/content/assets/images/git_pull.png)

Activate your Python virtual environment by typing `poetry shell`, follow it with a `which python` to make sure your python execution path has been updated.

```bash
poetry shell
```
