# Ansible Execution Environment: Mist and Netbox

[![N|Solid](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/netbox_logo.svg)](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/)

## Overview

This project aims to bring Juniper's Mist and Netbox functionality into Ansible AWX through the construct of an Execution Environment.

### 🐍 `Prep your Python environment`

I have included a Poetry file for anyone saavy enough to take advantage. For the uninitiated, Poetry helps replicate Python environments between users with a single file. You'll need to have Poetry installed on your machine, for most users that will be solved with `pip install poetry`.

1. install Python dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

2. activate environment

```bash
poetry shell
```

## 🐳 `Executing the build`

build the container image with

```bash
ansible-builder build --tag registry.gitlab.com/cremsburg/ansible-ee-netbox-inventory
```

### 〰️ `Notes about Docker`

If you are unsure if Docker is installed on your computer, then it's probably safe to suggest that it's not. If you're interested in learning more about the product, I encourage you to read a few blogs on the topic. A personal recommendation would be [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-and-use-docker#:~:text=Docker%20is%20an%20application%20that,on%20the%20host%20operating%20system.)

Some of the goodies placed in the `docker` folder are not relevant to our use case with Python. Feel free to delete them as you see fit, I simply wanted to share with you my Docker build process for all Juniper automation projects (including those based on Ansible). The world is your oyster and I won't judge you on whatever direction you take.

### 〰️ `Notes about Python Virtual Environments`

Similar to Docker, if you are unsure if you're using Python Virtual Environment features, it is safe to suggest that you're not. You are *strongly* recommended to using a Python Virtual Environment everywhere. You can really mess up your machine if you're too lazy and say "ehh, that seems like it's not important". It is. If it sounds like I'm speaking from experience, well I'll never admit to it.

If you're interested in learning more about setting up Virtual Environments, I encourage you to read a few blogs on the topic. A personal recommendation would be
