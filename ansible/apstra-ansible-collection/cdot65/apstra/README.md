# Ansible Collection - cdot65.apstra

[![N|Solid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdot65/svg-locker-shhhhh/master/apstra_0.3x.png)](https://juniper.net/)

## Overview

The goal of this collection is to provide an easier way to interact with Juniper's Apstra solution. While nothing will stop you from using the built-in module, you may find that working with pre-packaged modules can help simplify the development of your playbook, or it may just be easier to support as a team.

## ðŸ“‹ Ansible version compatibility

Ansible has performed a significant change to their versioning lately, we will be testing with versions 2.10.x

## Batteries Included

Here is a short list of modules included within the collection, expect feature parity with the Swagger before this project hits `version 0.1.0`

## ðŸš€ Executing the playbook

After installing the collections, you can call the modules by using their full name path.

> test.yaml

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: False
  become: False
  tasks:
    - name: Manage an IP Pool Resource with two prefixes
      cdot65.apstra.resources:
        # define server connectivity options
        server: apstra.dmz.home
        api_token: "{{ api_token }}"

        # define resource allocations
        display_name: "cicd_test"
        type: "ip-pool"
        subnets:
          - "100.1.1.0/24"
          - "100.1.2.0/24"

        # state whether you want to create or delete this resource
        state: present
```

Then simply run your playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook test.yaml
```

If you used Ansible Vault to encrypt your secrets, you need to append the `--ask-vault-pass` to your command.

## Very Important!

Please make sure to manage your sensative information carfully. While the modules support the parameter of `api_key`, this should never be statically entered with your token in clear text.

Here are better alternatives:

### Manage your API token as an environmental

```bash
export APSTRA_API_TOKEN='YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE'
```

> you can also use `APSTRA_API_KEY`, if you prefer

### Manage your API token as a secret with Ansible Vault

create a file to store your API token in

> vim vault.yaml

```yaml
api_token: "MY_APSTRA_API_TOKEN_HERE"
```

encrypt the new file

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt vault.yml
```

and now you'll need to pass your vault password when using the playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass test.yaml
```
