# Juniper PyEZ Example: Retrieve Version Information

This example will show how to use PyEZ to 

1. build a NETCONF connection to a remote device
2. execute the RPC command of `get-software-information`
3. print the output to the screen

## üöÄ `Executing the script`

This project provides two unique methods of executing the script:

1. Docker
2. Your own Python environment

### üê≥ `Docker`

1. build the container image with

```sh
make container
```

2. run the playbook within the container

```sh
make python
```

#### „Ä∞Ô∏è `Notes about Docker`

If you are unsure if Docker is installed on your computer, then it's probably safe to suggest that it's not. If you're interested in learning more about the product, I encourage you to read a few blogs on the topic. A personal recommendation would be [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-and-use-docker#:~:text=Docker%20is%20an%20application%20that,on%20the%20host%20operating%20system.)

Some of the goodies placed in the `docker` folder are not relevant to our use case with Python. Feel free to delete them as you see fit, I simply wanted to share with you my Docker build process for all Juniper automation projects (including those based on Ansible). The world is your oyster and I won't judge you on whatever direction you take.

### üêç `Your own Python environment`

1. install python dependencies 

```sh
pip install -r docker/requirements.txt
```

2. change into Python directory 

```
cd python
```

3. type in your terminal

```sh
python app.py
```

#### „Ä∞Ô∏è `Notes about Python Virtual Environments`

Similar to Docker, if you are unsure if you're using Python Virtual Environment features, it is safe to suggest that you're not. You are *strongly* recommended to using a Python Virtual Environment everywhere. You can really mess up your machine if you're too lazy and say "ehh, that seems like it's not important". It is. If it sounds like I'm speaking from experience, well I'll never admit to it.

If you're interested in learning more about setting up Virtual Environments, I encourage you to read a few blogs on the topic. A personal recommendation would be

## ‚öôÔ∏è `How it works`

Let's take a second to do a nice John Madden play-by-play on this script:

```python
from jnpr.junos import Device
from pprint import pprint
import json


with Device(host='dallas-fw0', user='automation', password='juniper123') as network_device:
    try:
        show_version = network_device.rpc.get_software_information({'format': 'json'})
    except:
        pass

pprint(show_version)
```

- We need to import the PyEZ package into our script
- Specifically, we are looking to import the `Device` method from the base `jnpr.junos` package
- `Device` will help us manage our SSH/NETCONF connection to the remote device

```python
from jnpr.junos import Device
```

- To help us work with the `json` data format, we will import the `json` package
- To help make the output stand out a little more, we will import the `pretty-print` package

```python
from pprint import pprint
import json
```

- Our goal now is to build the SSH connection to the remote device
- We create a new Python object called `network_device`, based on the parameters passed into the `Device` class

```python
with Device(host='dallas-fw0', user='automation', password='juniper123') as network_device:
```

- by using the `try/exempt` feature in Python, we can enable our script to handle exception errors easily.
- here we tell Python to "try to do this code, but if you get an exemption, go about your day"
- the code we're running in `try/exempt` is making a remote proceedure call (RPC) for the routing table
- we pass an argument into the request, asking for the return payload be structured in JSON
- the resulting output from the RPC is stored in a new object called `show_version`

```python
    try:
        show_version = network_device.rpc.get_software_information({'format': 'json'})
    except:
        pass
```

- finally, we are simply printing out the object `show_version` to the screen.
- using the `pprint` function we imported at the top of the screen, we get basic formatting of our object.

```python
pprint(show_version)
```
