Welcome to the Juniper PyEZ L3VPN MPLS demo ðŸŽ‰

This project is for network developers looking to build, deploy, and validate a production-ready MPLS network on Juniper vMX routers.

For those looking to get started with either network automation or MPLS L3VPN circuits, this project can help you get familiar with the concepts and technologies necessary for success.

Juniper vLabs will be used as our reference topology throughout the documentation, but note that we have also included an EVE-NG topology for those interested in running this project locally.
