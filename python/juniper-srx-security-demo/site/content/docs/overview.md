## üéâ Welcome

Welcome to the repository that manages the demonstration of using PyEZ to build, validate, and deploy security configurations on Juniper vSRX firewalls.

It is my hope that this repository helps those looking to understand more about firewalls or how Python applies to the networking world.

## ‚ùì How to use this guide

The navigation menu on the left hand of this site will be the best method of navigating between the documents.

### Automation

This is the meat and potatoes of our documentation, even for those just looking for a firewall example.

We will cover how configurations are built, where they are stored, and how do they get pushed to our remote devices. Network validation will also be leveraged to ensure us that the firewall configuration is working.

The all-important code deep dive will be taking place here, and we will discuss the various tools that are provided in the project files to make our lives easier.

### Network

This can be considered optional if you're only here for the Python, but it's really cool too. We will cover topics like IP addressing, configurations, and control-plane details.

### Lab Environment

This section can be considered optional, only to be referenced if you're planning to execute this project firsthand.
