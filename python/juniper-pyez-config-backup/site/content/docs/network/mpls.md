## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This section explains our generated MPLS configuration.

We will be using LDP for signaling labels, which will limit the features we can perform within the network while conversely making it easier to provision.

To build an MPLS neighborship with LDP between two router interfaces, you will see in the configurations that a few parameters need to be setup:

---

## Enable MPLS on interface

We'll start by enabling the family of MPLS on the interface configuration

```
set interfaces ge-0/0/1.0 family mpls
```

---

## Configure MPLS and LDP

Adding our interface to the MPLS and LDP protocols will be the end of our MPLS configuration

```
set protocols mpls interface ge-0/0/1.0
set protocols ldp interface ge-0/0/1.0
```

---

## Route Distinguisher

Each router participating within the MPLS L3VPN circuit will build their route-distinguisher off a similar pattern to our loopbacks, `192.168.255.{x}:100`, where `{x}` represents the router's ID

```
set routing-instances Customer1 instance-type vrf
set routing-instances Customer1 route-distinguisher 192.168.255.11:100
```

---

## Route Target

The routes that we import and export will be managed by the `target:{a}:{b}` structure, where `{a}` represents the BGP ASN and `{b}` respresents the customer's ID

```
set routing-instances Customer1 vrf-target target:300:100
```
