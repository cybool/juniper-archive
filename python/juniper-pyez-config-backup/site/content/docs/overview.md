## üéâ Welcome

This project is for network developers looking to build, deploy, and validate an MPLS network on Juniper vMX routers.

For those looking to get started with either network automation or MPLS L3VPN circuits, this project can help you get familiar with the concepts and technologies necessary for success.

## ‚ùì How to use this guide

The navigation menu on the left hand of this site will be the best method of navigating between the documents.

### Automation

This is the meat and potatoes of our documentation, even for those just looking for an MPLS example.

We will cover how configurations are built, where they are stored, and how do they get pushed to our remote devices. Network validation will also be leveraged to ensure us that the MPLS L3VPN circuit is working.

The all-important code deep dive will be taking place here, and we will discuss the various tools that are provided in the project files to make our lives easier.

### Network

This can be considered optional if you're only here for the Python, but it's really cool too. We will cover topics like IP addressing, MPLS configurations, and control-plane details.

### Lab Environment

This section can be considered optional, only to be referenced if you're planning to execute this project firsthand.
