## üìå Overview

This script will be ran when you'd like to generate and push a device's configuration using PyEZ.

## üêç Files

Recall that all of our project's automation files are stored within the [files/python](https://github.com/cdot65/juniper-mpls-l3vpn-demo/tree/main/files/python) directory.

```bash
files/python
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configurations/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vars/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configure.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ download.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inventory.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rollback.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validate.py
```

Our attention in this section will be upon the `configure.py` script.

## üìù Code Deep Dive

### Imports

We will be importing inventory data into our script from a local file named `inventory.yaml`, so we need to `import yaml` to handle this functionality.

```python
import yaml
from jnpr.junos import Device
from jnpr.junos.utils.config import Config
```

Two primary functions of PyEZ will be imported, the first of which is the `Device` object. `Device` will allow us to model our device's parameters, things like IP address, username, and the sort. But `Device` will also enable us to build and maintain a NETCONF session to our remote device, so this object Class really does most of the heavy lifting here.

From the utilities module, we will be importing the `Config` class, which will (obviously) handle the configuration aspects of our script.

---

### Configurations

We will find a need to make adjustments to some of the default behavior of packages, and in some cases create an object to define some parameter.

---

#### Inventory

We are declaring our device inventory in a YAML markdown, since YAML is easy for humans and powerful for machines.

```python
def inventory():
    devices = yaml.safe_load(open("inventory.yaml"))
    return devices
```

Here we are taking advantage of the `yaml` library we imported and calling the `safe_load` method to load in the data from our `inventory.yaml` file.

The function returns our list of devices as an object called `devices`.

---

### `main()`

For our script's main function, we will loop over our list of routers that we imported from `inventory.yaml` to open a NETCONF session.

```python
def main(devices):
    for each in devices["routers"]:
        dev = Device(
            host=f"{each['ip']}",
            user="jcluser",
            password="juniper123",
            gather_facts=False,
        )
        dev.open()

```

After printing a status message to the console, we will be creating an empty dictionary called `data` and then stuffing our YAML vars into it as `data['configuration']`.

The only reason this is here is to help handle the fact that PyEZ and Jinja2 library load YAML vars differently than each other.

```python
print(f"connected to {each['name']}")

data = dict()
data["configuration"] = yaml.safe_load(open(f"vars/{each['name']}.yaml"))
```

---

We pass on the object that represents our device into the `Config` class, which will create a new object called `configuration` to represent our device's configuration.

```python
configuration = Config(dev)

configuration.load(
    template_path="templates/junos.j2", template_vars=data, format="set"
)
```

Next we see that we run the `load` method of our recently created `configuration` object, and we pass it three options:

1. Point to our Jinja2 template file at `templates/junos.j2`
2. Point to our device's variables (the `data` object created above)
3. Declare that our configuration is in the `set`format, alternatives would be `text`, `xml`, or `json`

This will push the device's configuration to the candidate config database, but will not commit it just yet.

---

We perform three functions upon the candidate configuration database:

1. Report any configuration diff to the console.
2. Perform a configuration check to make sure our generated configuration is valid.
3. Commit the configuration.

```python
configuration.pdiff()
if configuration.commit_check():
    configuration.commit()
else:
    configuration.rollback()

dev.close()
```

Should the configuration fail the configuration check, roll back to the previous state.

Close our NETCONF session.

---

### Initialize

There are thousands of explanations on `if __name__ == "__main__":` within Python, I will rely on your Google skills to find you the one that makes the most sense. In short, we need this so leave it alone.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    devices = inventory()
    main(devices)

```

We will first load our inventory.yaml file into a new Python object `devices`.

Our main function will run next, which will take care of the templating and pushing of our configurations to the remote devices.

---

## üöÄ Workflow

Make sure your Python Virtual Environment has the necessary packages installed.

> **Reminder**: a [Poetry lock file has been provided](https://cdot65.github.io/juniper-mpls-l3vpn-demo/docs/automation/poetry/) to help create your virtual environment to reflect ours. You will need to have [Poetry installed](https://python-poetry.org/).

Change into the `files/python` directory and execute the script

```bash
cd files/python
python configure.py
```

An alternative method of executing the script would be to leverage the Docker container provided with this project.

```bash
invoke configure
```
